    In this big room, N_{agents} move around and observe N_{humans} placing objects.
    Every time the agents move around (i.e., take a step), they observe one human_{i}
    placing an object somewhere. Each agent can only observe one human at a time.
    Every time the agents takes a step, the environment also asks them where an object
    is. +1 reward is given when it gets right and 0 when it gets wrong.

    This environment is challenging in two ways:

    (1) An agent can't observe the entire room. It can only observe one human at a time.
    This means that the environment is only partially observable. This constraint means
    that it's more beneficial if more than one agent can collaborate. This constraint
    also means that the agents should have a memory system to remember the past
    observations.

    (2) The room environment changes every time. The humans can switch their locations,
    change their objects, and place them at different locations. These changes are
    not completely random. A decent portion of them come from commmon-sense knowledge.
    This means that an agent with both episodic and semantic memory systems will perform
    better than an agent with only one memory system.
